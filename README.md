> SystemVerilog-based APB slave design with a class-based testbench using virtual interfaces, mailboxes, and random stimulus generation. Includes aligned 32-bit read/write support, byte-wise enables, and error handling. Compatible with QuestaSim 10.4e. Great for learning protocol modeling.
# APB Slave Design with SystemVerilog Testbench

This repository contains a SystemVerilog implementation of an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) slave along with a class-based testbench using mailbox communication, virtual interfaces, and random transactions. It is designed to run on **QuestaSim 10.4e** or compatible simulators.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… APB slave supporting aligned 32-bit read and write operations  
- âœ… Byte-wise write enables via `pstrobe`  
- âœ… Error detection for unaligned accesses (`pslaverr`)  
- âœ… Modular testbench using:
  - `pkt`: Transaction class
  - `gen`: Random transaction generator
  - `bfm`: Bus functional model
  - `apb_interface`: Connects DUT and testbench
